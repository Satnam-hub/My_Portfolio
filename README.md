From the very beginning, i would like to tell about my first job and income. So, i started my first job at the age of 18 as a Truck Driver And i was earning around $1600 cad a month. I did that job for 11 months. It was a nice experience and the best thing about it was i learned alot of new things. At the same time, i got to know that how to save money. Where I should spend money, where not. Secondly, i worked in a cloth company called suzy sheir. Here i was earning quite less than my first job but here too i learned alot of things. Specially, i started thinking about starting my own business, after read about CEO of google and suzy sheir who was actually a very intelligent man. 2 months ago, Start investing money ðŸ’µ  in stocks, majorly i brought shares form blockchain technologies and ciniplex.
